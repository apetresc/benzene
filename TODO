Benzene TODO file
=================

broderic [090218] (in rough order of importance)
* Parallel solver
* Support reading installed shared data in $(pkgdatadir)
* Have Wolve check TT for losing moves in move generation.
* Remove lssolve from src/util/ and replace with boost::ublas
* Make GroupBoard and PatternBoard not derive off of StoneBoard
* Add HexBoard::Resize() method; use in SyncBoard()
* Proof class in Solver
  * Proof class should do assertions, reductions
  * Support permanently inferior in solver
* Add ponder ability to Wolve and MoHex
* Refactor OpeningBook class to be game independent
* Executable for building opening books (?)

ph [081113]
* Tournament tool improvements:
  * asymmetric.py should print opening, not just sgf numbers
  * summary.py should give whole opening, not just first move
  * should have script for post-game sgf analysis with solver
* Solver should do 2 sweeps during move ordering:
  * DB and TT checks only in first sweep, mustplay and vc-build 2nd sweep
* Unique probe sequence for solver:
  * Create pattern file
  * If losing move and winning reply match pattern, try no more
* Induced path transpositions for solver:
  * Create induced path equivalence file
  * Create induced path domination file
  * Create induced path inferiority file
  * Apply files to get more DB transpositions by shifting played moves
* Proof-set pruned states should be stored in DB/TT
* Website stuff:
  * Create handicap Java applet
  * Create bibtex file of Hex resources
  * Create annotated bibliography of Hex resources
* MoHex improvements:
  * Root parallelization
  * Learned-reponse array through UCT tree sequences (used for node init)
* Wolve improvements:
  * Make 4-ply feasible (no need to go through edge)
  * Re-create opening book (requires DB switch and OB change first)
  * Eliminate hand-book
* Inferior cell improvements:
  * Implement algorithm developed with Laurie to find more dead cell patterns
  * Develop similar algorithm for captured
  * Create larger list of vulnerable and dominated from above work
* Virtual-connection improvements:
  * Backing-up connections
  * Identify Noshita under special conditions (theory in progress)
* Mustplay mask
