Regression testing README
=========================

To run the tests, do:

% ./run.sh

To see the available options:

% ./run.sh -h

Some tests require certain settings if you want the results to match the 
expected results in the script. These settings are in the 
'settings-X.htp" for test 'X.st'. For example, the settings for 'vc.tst' 
are in 'settings-vc.htp'.
