Regression testing README
=========================

To run the tests, do:

% ./run.sh

To see the available options:

% ./run.sh -h

Make sure you have a 'gtpregress' tool in the root regression
directory. You can find such a tool in the bin/ directory of 'gogui'.
Copy the bin/gtpregress script and the lib/gtpregress.jar files to the
root regression directory, and edit the script so it points the
the jar correctly.
