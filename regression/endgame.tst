# Tests endgame play.
#
# Note 1: Only cells that are not inferior are considered, so technically
#         not all winning responses are accepted as correct.
# Note 2: When some winning moves are much shorter/preferable/easier to
#         maintain than others, then the harder winning moves may be
#         considered failures. However, in such cases a comment must be
#         made below to indicate this is the case.
# Note 3: Expected test outcomes are based on wolve (22/39 pass).
#         Mohex with 2k rollouts per cell a bit faster, and passes
#         ~23 tests (subject to variance).
