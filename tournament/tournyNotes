Summary
- Improved ICE performs worse due to weird evaluation function (1->2->3)
- Iterative deepening and parallel boards may help a little (3->4)
- Push rule doesn't seem to help (4->5)
- Opening book is neutral/helps a bit (4->6)
- Augmenting VC matrix with parallel board has little effect (4->7)
- Combining matrix augmentation with push rule performs worse (7->8)
- On book openings wolve shows great asymmetry (9,10 - numbers indicate halfway and total, showing latter half is ~20% worse!!). Note the version using the opening book is more polarized.
- Improving handbook gains quite a few more percent (10->11)
- Adding solver pre-check gains a few more percent, even on slow computer (11->12)
- Going to 4-ply adds a lot of strength (12->13), and actually does slightly better not going through the edge (13->14)!!

Summary
- Increasing rollouts to 375k really helped (1->2), but beyond that we don't
  see big gains (4725k was ~100 ELO stronger)
- Triggers were useless/bad (2->3)
- ICE, decompositions, moves to consider, VCs, etc all help (3->4->5->6)
- Fuego sucks (6->7), unless adjust bias terms in which case no diff (6->8)
- Push rule helps improve mohex a bit more as well (8->9)
- Despite strong play on 11x11, likely openings were ~50% (10)
- The opening book gave a welcome boost however (10->11)
- Local bias seems to help a bit at lower amounts (9->12, 9->13). Minor gains (if any) on the book openings without the book (11->15) which oddly performs better than with (11->14).
- Local bias at 10% seems much better on the book openings, despite not using the book (11/15->17). Over all openings not much difference (9/12->16).
- Super ICE *without* 3-sided dead makes no difference (9->18).
- Positive tree initialization seems to have no effect or slightly negative, both for radius 1 and radius 2 (9->19/20). Negative tree initialization has no significant effect at low or high weights (9->21/22).
- Super ICE with 3-sided dead is better (9->23) but PI makes it worse again (9->24), so won't use the latter.
- Still need to test CG 2008 version with solver pre-check... but provably cannot harm its winning percentage
