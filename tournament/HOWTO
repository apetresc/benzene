How to run a tournament:

1) Run a tournament with twogtp.py.

   Some points:
     * Programs alternate playing each opening in the set of openings
       provided.  Each round corresponds to each program playing black once
       for each opening.

   An example tournament where Wolve with new settings plays against
   itself with old settings:

    ./twogtp.py \
      --p1cmd="../bin/wolve.exe --config new.htp" --p1name="new-wolve" \
      --p2cmd="../bin/wolve.exe --config old.htp" --p2name="old-wovle" \
      --dir="new-vs-old" --size 11 --rounds 3 \
      --openings="openings/11x11-all-1ply"

3) The 'results' file.  

The 'results' file contains a listing of the completed games and
results.  If you stop the tournament script for any reason (or if it
detects an error and stops itself), you will lose only the last game
played.  You can continue the tournament using the same command you used
to start it.

4) the nnnn.sgf files. 

These are the actual games played.  Each sgf file lists the exact
arguments sent to the programs so you should be able to recreate the
game as long as your programs are deterministic (i.e, after the initial
seed value to their random number generator). 

5) Getting a summary. 

At any time, you may run 

   ./summary --file [results file] [--random]

to obtain a compact summary of the tournament results so far.  The
results will be broken down by opening. Use the "--random" command if
you want to games down by opening and show which were split and
non-split.

6) The openings.

The available openings are found under the openings/ directory. 
Each file contains exactly one opening per line. Make sure there
are no extra empty lines at the end of the file, as currently, every
line is used as an opening.
