util/        misc things: random numbers, timing stuff, hashmap, logger,
             changelog, etc.

Building:
=========

You will need project_explorer/sg includes and library objects. Make a
symbolic link in the main repository directory to the project_explorer
directory. Eg:

% pwd
[blah]/project_wolve2.0/trunk/
% ln -s [directory containing explorer] project_explorer


'make' will build a debug version of the code base. 
'make BUILDTYPE=release' will build a release version.
'make PROFILE=1' will build a profiling version.
'make test' will build and then run the unit test suite. 

Comments:
=========

This code changes very rapidly.  Nothing in here is safe from
being changed in the future...
