/** TwoDistance Evaluation Function.
    
    Computes the two distance from each cell to each of the four
    edges.  The two distance is the second shortest distance between
    two cells (1 if they are adjacent, and infinity if fewer than two
    connecting paths exist).
  
    This evaluation function requires that the VCs be precalculated
    for the given board state.  This calcuation runs in O(n^2) time,
    where n is the number of cells on the board.

    @bug if NeighbourType is FULL_VC then the distance returned is not
    accurate since one cell we have a vc with could affect another
    cell we have a vc with.
