Explorer uses Boost.Test as a unit test framework,
see http://boost.org/libs/test/doc/index.html

Installation
------------

The Boost library has to be installed on the system, currently the tests
should work with Boost version 1.31, 1.32 or 1.33.
On Linux Fedora Core 3 and Fedora Core 4, nothing has to be done, if the
package boost is installed.
On Mac OS, the boost library has to be installed with Fink or by downloading
and installing Boost from http://boost.org and setting the environment
variable:
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include/boost-1_33

Running
-------

To compile and run the tests, do a

make test

in /src

Adding Tests
------------

Example:
The unit tests for hex/VC.cpp are in hex/test/VCTest.cpp.
Write the tests using the Boost.Test auto-registration facility,
see hex/test/VCTest.cpp for an example.
Don't forget to add the test source files to test/Makefile.prj.inc.
